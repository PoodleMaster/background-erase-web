# background-erase-web
- Recognizes the object in the photo and erases the background.
- Only png can be selected.

# â– Requirements
- python 3.8+
- Linux is required when using gunicorn. (Currently gunicorn does not support windows. In case of win10, Gunicorn can also be operated by using Docker or WSL2.)

# â– Install
- Apprication Git Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/PoodleMaster/background-erase-web
cd background-erase-web
```

- Python environment creation
```
conda create -n bge38 python=3.8
conda activate bge38
```

# â– Local Server startup
How to start when Localhost is used as a server.

## (A) When using Docker
Execute (A-3)-a when using docker-compose, and (A-3)-b when not using docker-compose.

### (A-1). Docker File Setting
Set up Docker File.
```
cp Dockerfile.heroku Dockerfile
```

### (A-2) "u2net.pth" Get
Please execute "get_u2net.py" in advance to get "u2net.pth".
Even if you don't copy .u2net into docker, it will be automatically acquired when rembg is running.
However, it is very large at 168MB, so it is recommended to download it in advance.
```
python get_u2net.py
```

### (A-3)-a Using Docker-compose
- Execution command

You can execute it until startup with one command.
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

- Execution example
```

## (B) Without Docker
Execute (B-2)-a when using Gunicorn, and (B-2)-b when using Flask.

### (B-1) Install the python library.
```
conda install gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### (B-2)-a Using Gunicorn
- Execution command

Start the server using the HTTP server (gunicorn) command.
```
gunicorn --bind=localhost:8000 server:app
```

- Execution example
```
[2021-07-16 14:00:02 +0900] [845] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0

```
ðŸ‘‰http://localhost:8000/

## (B-2)-b Using Flask
- Execution command

Even if you don't have an HTTP server (gunicorn), you can run it with Flask's simple HTTP server function.
```
python server.py
```

- Execution example
``` 
 * Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:9000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
